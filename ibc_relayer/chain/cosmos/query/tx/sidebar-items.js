It returns at most one packet event for each sequence specified in the request. Note - there is no way to format the packet query such that it asks for Tx-es with either sequence (the query conditions can only be AND-ed). There is a possibility to include “<=” and “>=” conditions but it doesn’t work with string attributes (sequence is emmitted as a string). Therefore, for packets we perform one tx_search for each sequence. Alternatively, a single query for all packets could be performed but it would return all packets ever sent."],["query_tx_response",""],["query_txs","This function queries transactions for events matching certain criteria."]]};
